\chapter{Case Study: Word Play}
\label{wordplay}

This chapter is intended to let you practice and 
consolidate the knowledge you have acquired so far, 
rather than introducing new concepts. To help you gain 
experience with programming, we will cover a 
case study that involves solving word puzzles by 
searching for words that have certain properties.  
For example, we'll find the longest palindromes
in English and search for words whose letters appear in
alphabetical order.  And I will present another program 
development plan: reduction to a previously solved problem.


\section{Reading from and Writing to Files}

For the exercises in this chapter, we will need our 
programs to read text from files. In many programming 
languages, this often means that we need a statement to 
open a file, then a statement or group of statements to 
read the file's content, and finally a statement to 
close the file (although this last operation may 
be performed automatically in some circumstances).
\index{file!reading from}
\index{file!writing to}
\index{file!open statement}
\index{file!close statement}

We are interested here in text files that are usually 
made of lines separated by logical new line characters; 
depending on your operating system, such logical new line 
characters consist of either one (Linux, Mac) or two (Windows) 
physical characters (bytes). 
\index{newline character}

The Perl built-in function {\tt open} takes the path and 
name of the file as a parameter and returns a {\bf file 
handle} ({\tt IO::Handle object}) which you can use to read 
the file (or to write to it):
\index{open function}
\index{function!open}
\index{plain text}
\index{text!plain}
\index{object!file}
\index{file handle}
\index{function!slurp-rest}

\begin{verbatim}
my $fh = open("path/to/myfile.txt", :r);
my $data = $fh.slurp-rest;
$fh.close;
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt :r} option is the file mode ({\tt read}). {\tt \$fh} is a 
common name for a file handle.  The \emph{file object} provides methods 
for reading, such as {\tt slurp-rest} which returns the 
full content of the file from the current position to the 
end (and the entire content of the file if we've just 
opened it).

This is the traditional way of opening and reading files 
in most languages.
\index{read mode}
\index{file mode!read}

However, Perl's {\tt IO} role (in simple terms, a role is 
a collection of related methods) offers simpler methods which 
can open a file and read it all in one single instruction (i.e., 
without having to first open a file handle and then close it):
\index{role}
\index{IO role}

\begin{verbatim}
my $text = slurp "path/to/myfile.txt";
# or:
my $text = "path/to/myfile.txt".IO.slurp;
\end{verbatim}
%

\index{slurp function}
{\tt slurp} takes care of opening and closing the file for you.

We can also read the file line by line, which is very 
practical if each line contains a logical entity such as 
a record, and is especially useful for very large files 
that might not fit into memory:

\begin{verbatim}
for 'path/to/hugefile.txt'.IO.lines -> $line {
    # Do something with $line
}
\end{verbatim}
%
By default, the {\tt .lines} method will remove the trailing 
newline characters from each line, so that you don't have 
to worry about them.
\index{IO.lines method}
\index{IO.slurp method}
\index{slurp function}
%

We haven't studied arrays yet, but you can also read all 
lines of a file into an array, with each line of the file 
becoming an array item. For example, you can load the 
\emph{myfile.txt} file into the \verb'@lines' array:
\index{array}

\begin{verbatim}
my @lines = "myfile.txt".IO.lines;
\end{verbatim}
%

Accessing any line can then be done with the bracket operator 
and an index. For example, to print the first and the 
seventh line:

\begin{verbatim}
say @lines[0];
say @lines[6];
\end{verbatim}
%
To write data to a file, it is possible to {\tt open} a file just 
as when wanting to read from it, except that the {\tt :w} (write) 
option should be used:
\index{write mode}
\index{file mode!write}

\begin{verbatim}
my $fh = open("path/to/myfile.txt", :w);
$fh.say("line to be written to the file");
$fh.close;
\end{verbatim}

Be careful with this. If the file already existed, any 
existing content will be clobbered. So watch out when 
you want to open a file in write mode.

It is also possible to open the file in append mode, using the 
{\tt :a} option. New data will then be added after the existing 
content.
\index{append mode}
\index{file mode!append}

Writing to a file can be simplified using the {\tt spurt} 
function, which opens the file, writes the data to it, 
and closes it:
\index{spurt function}

\begin{verbatim}
spurt "path/to/myfile.txt", "line to be written to the file\n";
\end{verbatim}

Used this way, {\tt spurt} will clobber any existing content in 
the file. It may also be used in append mode with the {\tt :append} 
option:
\index{spurt function!append mode}

\begin{verbatim}
spurt "path/to/myfile.txt", "line to be added\n", :append;
\end{verbatim}


\section{Reading Word Lists}
\label{wordlist}

For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English 
words. There are lots of word lists available on the web, 
but one of the most suitable for our purpose is one of the 
word lists collected and contributed to the public domain 
by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexicon project (see 
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project}).  It is a 
list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is, words that are
considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games.  
In the Moby collection, the filename is \emph{113809of.fic}; 
you can download a copy, with the simpler name \emph{words.txt}, 
from \url{https://github.com/LaurentRosenfeld/thinkperl6/tree/master/Supplementary/words.txt}.
\index{Moby Project}
\index{crosswords}
\index{word list}

This file is in plain text (with each word of the list on 
its own line), so you can open it with a text
editor, but you can also read it from Perl. Let's do so 
in the interactive mode (with the REPL):
\index{interactive mode}
\index{REPL}

\begin{verbatim}
> my $fh = open("words.txt", :r);
IO::Handle<words.txt>(opened, at octet 0)
> my $line = get $fh;
aa
> say "<<$line>>";
<<aa>>
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt get} function reads one line from the file handle. 
\index{get function}

The first word in this particular list is ``aa'' (a kind 
of lava).

Printing the \verb'$line' variable between angle brackets 
within a string shows us that the {\tt get} function removed 
implicitly the trailing newline characters, in this 
case a \verb'\r\n' (carriage return and newline) character 
combination, since this file was apparently prepared under 
Windows.

The file handle keeps track of what has been read from the 
file and what it should read next, so if you call {\tt get} 
again, you obtain the next line:

\begin{verbatim}
> my $line = get $fh;
aah
\end{verbatim}
%
The next word is ``aah,'' which is a perfectly legitimate
word, so stop looking at me like that.

This is good and fine if we want to explore the first few 
lines of the {\tt words.txt} file, but we are not going to 
read the 113 k-lines of the file this way.

We need a loop to do it for us. We could insert the above 
{\tt get} instruction into a {\tt while} loop, but we have 
seen above an easier and more efficient way of doing it 
using a {\tt for} loop and the {\tt IO.lines} method, 
without the hassle of having to open or close the file:
\index{for loop}
\index{IO.lines method}

\begin{verbatim}
for 'words.txt'.IO.lines -> $line {
    say $line;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
This code reads the file line by line, and prints each line 
to the screen. We'll soon do more interesting things than 
just displaying the lines on the screen.

\section{Exercises}

This case study consists mainly of exercises and 
solutions to them within the body of the chapter because solving the 
exercises is the main teaching material of this chapter. Therefore, 
solutions to these exercises are in the following sections of 
this chapter, not in the appendix. You should at least 
attempt each one before you read the solutions.

\begin{exercise}
Write a program that reads {\tt words.txt} and prints only the
words with more than 20 characters.
\index{whitespace}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000-word novel 
called {\em Gadsby} that does not contain the letter ``e''. 
Since ``e'' is the most common letter in English, that's 
not easy to do. In fact, it is difficult to construct a 
solitary thought without using that most common letter. 
Such a  writing in which one letter is avoided is sometimes 
called a lipogram.
\index{Wright, Ernest Vincent}
\index{Gadsby}
\index{lipogram}

Write a subroutine called \verb"has-no-e" that returns 
{\tt True} if the given word doesn't have the letter ``e'' 
in it.
\label{no_e}

Modify your program from the previous exercise to print only 
the words that have no ``e'' and compute the percentage of 
the words in the list that have no ``e''.

(The word dictionary we are using, \emph{words.txt}, is 
entirely in lower-case letters, so you don't need to 
worry about any uppercase ``E.'')



\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 

Write a subroutine named {\tt avoids}
that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and
that returns {\tt True} if the word doesn't use any of 
the forbidden letters.

Next, modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string
of forbidden letters and then print the number of words that
don't contain any of them.
Can you find a combination of five forbidden letters that
excludes the smallest number of words?

\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}

Write a subroutine named \verb"uses-only" that takes a word and a
string of letters, and that returns {\tt True} if the word contains
only letters in the list.  Can you make a sentence using only the
letters {\tt acefhlo}?  Other than ``Hoe alfalfa?''

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 

Write a subroutine named \verb"uses-all" that takes a word and a
string of required letters, and returns {\tt True} if the word
uses all the required letters at least once.  How many words are there
that use all the vowels {\tt aeiou}?  How about {\tt aeiouy}?

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"is_abecedarian" that returns
{\tt True} if the letters in a word appear in alphabetical order
(double letters are ok).  
How many abecedarian words are there?

\index{abecedarian}

\end{exercise}



\section{Search}
\label{search}
\index{search!pattern}
\index{pattern!search}
\index{regex}

Most of the exercises in the previous section have something
in common; they can be solved with the search pattern (and 
the {\tt index} function we saw in Section~\ref{find} 
(p.~\pageref{find}). Most can also be solved using regexes.

\subsection{Words Longer Than 20 Characters (Solution)}

The solution to the simplest exercise ---printing all the 
words of {\tt words.txt} that are longer than 
20~characters--- is:

\begin{verbatim}
for 'words.txt'.IO.lines -> $line {
    say $line if $line.chars > 20
}
\end{verbatim}
%

Because the code is so simple, this is a typical example 
of a possible and useful one-liner (as described in 
Section~\ref{one-liner mode}). Assuming you want to know the words 
that are longer than 20~characters, you don't even need to 
write a script, save it, and run it. You can simply type this at 
your operating system prompt:
\label{one-liner-example}
\index{one-liner mode}

\begin{verbatim}
$ perl6 -n -e '$_.say if $_.chars > 20;' words.txt
\end{verbatim} 
%
The ``-e'' option tells Perl that the script to be run 
comes next on the command line between quotation marks. The 
``-n'' asks Perl to read line by line the file after the 
end of the command line, to store each line in the \verb'$_' 
topical variable, and to apply the content of the script to 
each line. And the one-liner script is just printing the 
content of \verb'$_' if its length is greater than 20.
\index{topical variable}

To simplify a bit, the two options \verb'-n' and \verb'-e' 
may be grouped together as \verb"perl6 -ne". In addition, 
the \verb'$_' topical variable can be omitted in method calls 
(in other words, if a method has no invocant, the invocant 
will be defaulted to \verb'$_'). Finally, the trailing 
semi-colon may also be removed. The one-liner above can 
thus be made somewhat simpler and shorter:
\index{invocant}

\begin{verbatim}
$ perl6 -ne '.say if .chars > 20' words.txt
\end{verbatim} 
%
Remember that, if you're trying this under Windows, you need to 
replace the single quotes with double quotes (and vice-versa if 
the scripts itself contains double quotes):

\begin{verbatim}
C:\Users\Laurent>perl6 -ne ".say if .chars > 20" words.txt
\end{verbatim} 
%

\subsection{Words with No ``e'' (Solution)}

A subroutine that returns {\tt True} for words that have 
no ``e'' (Exercise~\ref{no_e}) is also quite straight forward:

\begin{verbatim}
sub has-no-e (Str $word) {
    return True unless defined index $word, "e";
    return False;
}
\end{verbatim}
%

The subroutine simply returns {\tt True} if the {\tt index} 
function did not find any ``e'' in the word received as 
a parameter and {\tt False} otherwise. 

Note that this works correctly because the word list used 
\emph{words.txt}) is entirely in lowercase letters. The 
above subroutine would need to be modified if it might 
be called with words containing uppercase letters. 

Since the {\tt defined} function returns a Boolean value, we 
could shorten our subroutine to this::
\begin{verbatim}
sub has-no-e (Str $word) {
    not defined index $word, "e";
}
\end{verbatim}
%

We could also have used a regex for testing the presence of a 
``e'' on the second line of this subroutine:

\begin{verbatim}
    return True unless $word ~~ /e/;
\end{verbatim}
%

This fairly concise syntax is appealing, but when 
looking for an exact literal match, the {\tt index} function 
is likely to be slightly more efficient (faster) than a 
regex.

Looking for the words without ``e'' in our word list and 
counting them is not very difficult:

\begin{verbatim}
sub has-no-e (Str $word) {
    not defined index $word, "e";
}

my $total-count = 0;
my $count-no-e = 0;
for 'words.txt'.IO.lines -> $line { 
    $total-count++;
    if has-no-e $line {
        $count-no-e++;
        say $line;
    }
}
say "=" x 24;
say "Total word count: $total-count";
say "Words without 'e': $count-no-e";
printf "Percentage of words without 'e': %.2f %%\n", 
        100 * $count-no-e / $total-count;
\end{verbatim}

The above program will display the following at the end 
of its output:

\begin{verbatim}
========================
Total word count: 113809
Words without 'e': 37641
Percentage of words without 'e': 33.07 %
\end{verbatim}

So, less than one third of the words of 
our list have no ``e.''

\subsection{Avoiding Other Letters (Solution)}

\index{generalization}
The {\tt avoids} subroutine is a more general version of 
\verb"has_no_e", but it has the same structure:

\begin{verbatim}
sub avoids (Str $word, Str $forbidden) {
    for 0..$forbidden.chars - 1 -> $idx {
        my $letter = substr $forbidden, $idx, 1;
        return False if defined index $word, $letter;
    }
    True;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
We can return {\tt False} as soon as we find a forbidden letter;
if we get to the end of the loop, we return {\tt True}. Since 
a subroutine returns the last evaluated expression, we don't 
need to explicitly use a {\tt return True} statement in the last 
code line above. I used this feature here as an example; you might 
find it clearer to explicitly {\tt return} values, except 
perhaps for very simple one-line subroutines.

Note that we have here implicitly two nested loops. We could 
reverse the outer and the inner loops:

\begin{verbatim}
sub avoids (Str $word, Str $forbidden) {
    for 0..$words.chars - 1 -> $idx {
        my $letter = substr $words, $idx, 1;
        return False if defined index $forbidden, $letter;
    }
    True;
}
\end{verbatim}
%

The main code calling the above subroutine is similar to 
the code calling {\tt has-no-e} and might look like 
this:

\begin{verbatim}
my $total-count = 0;
my $count-no-forbidden = 0;

for 'words.txt'.IO.lines -> $line { 
    $total-count++;
    $count-no-forbidden++ if avoids $line, "eiou";
}

say "=" x 24;
say "Total word count: $total-count";
say "Words without forbidden: $count-no-forbidden";
printf "Percentage of words with no forbidden letter: %.2f %%\n", 
        100 * $count-no-forbidden / $total-count;
\end{verbatim}    
%
  

\subsection{Using Only Some Letters (Solution)}

\verb"uses-only" is similar to our {\tt avoids} subroutine 
except that the sense of the condition is reversed:

\begin{verbatim}
sub uses-only (Str $word, Str $available) {
    for 0..$word.chars - 1 -> $idx {
        my $letter = substr $word, $idx, 1;
        return False unless defined index $available, $letter;
    }
    True;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list 
of available letters.  If we find a letter in {\tt word} that 
is not in {\tt available}, we can return {\tt False}. And 
we return {\tt True} if we reach the loop end.

\subsection{Using All Letters of a List (Solution)}

\verb"uses-all" is similar to the previous two subroutines, 
except that we reverse the role of the word and the string 
of letters:

\begin{verbatim}
sub uses-all(Str $word, Str $required) {
    for 0..$required.chars - 1 -> $idx {
        my $letter = substr $word, $idx, 1;
        return False unless defined index $word, $letter;
    }
    return True;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
Instead of traversing the letters in {\tt \$word}, the loop
traverses the required letters.  If any of the required letters
do not appear in the word, we can return {\tt False}.
\index{traversal}

If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would
have recognized that \verb"uses-all" was an instance of a
previously solved problem in reverse: if word~A uses all 
letters of word~B, then word~B uses only letters of word~A. So, 
we can call the {\tt uses-only} subroutine and write:

\begin{verbatim}
sub uses-all ($word, $required) {
    return uses-only $required, $word;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
This is an example of a program development plan called 
{\bf reduction to a previously solved problem}, which means that you
recognize the problem you are working on as an instance of a solved
problem and apply an existing solution. 
\index{reduction to a previously solved problem} 
\index{development plan!reduction}

\subsection{Alphabetic Order (Solution)}

For \verb"is_abecedarian" we have to compare adjacent letters. 
Each time in our {\tt for} loop, we define one letter as our 
current letter and compare it with the previous one:

\begin{verbatim}
sub is_abecedarian ($word) {
    for 1..$word.chars - 1 -> $idx {    
        my $curr-letter = substr $word, $idx, 1;
        return False if $curr-letter lt substr $word, $idx - 1, 1;  
    }     
    return True
}
\end{verbatim}

An alternative is to use recursion:
\index{recursion}

\begin{verbatim}
sub is-abecedarian (Str $word) {
    return True if $word.chars <= 1;
    return False if substr($word, 0, 1) gt substr($word, 1, 1);
    return is-abecedarian substr $word, 1;
}
\end{verbatim}

Another option is to use a {\tt while} loop:

\begin{verbatim}
sub is_abecedarian (Str $word):
    my $i = 0;
    while $i < $word.chars -1 {
        if substr($word, $i, 1) gt substr ($word, $i+1, 1) {
            return False;
        }
        $i++;
    }
    return True;
}
\end{verbatim}
%
The loop starts at {\tt \$i=0} and ends when {\tt i=\$word.chars -1}.  Each
time through the loop, it compares the $i$th character (which you can
think of as the current character) to the $i+1$th character (which you
can think of as the next).

If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current
one, then we have discovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and
we return {\tt False}.

If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the
word passes the test.  To convince yourself that the loop ends
correctly, consider an example like \verb"'flossy'".  The
length of the word is 6, so
the last time the loop runs is when \verb'$i' is 4, which is the
index of the second-to-last character.  On the last iteration,
it compares the second-to-last character (the second ``s'') to 
the last (the ``y''), which is what we want.

\subsection{Another Example of Reduction to a Previously Solved Problem}

\index{palindrome}
\label{palindrome_2}
Here is a version of \verb"is_palindrome" (see
Exercise~\ref{palindrome}) that uses two indices; one starts at the
beginning and goes up, while the other starts at the end and goes down:		

\begin{verbatim}
sub one-char (Str $string, $idx) {
    return substr $string, $idx, 1;
}
sub is-palindrome (Str $word) {
    my $i = 0;
    my $j = $word.chars - 1;

    while $i < $j {
        return False if one-char($word, $i) ne one-char($word, $j);
        $i++;
        $j--;
    }
    return True;
}
\end{verbatim}

Or we could reduce to a previously solved
problem and write:
\index{reduction to a previously solved problem}
\index{development plan!reduction}

\begin{verbatim}
sub is-palindrome (Str $word) {
    return is-reverse($word, $word)
}
\end{verbatim}
%
using \verb"is-reverse" from Section~\ref{isreverse} (but
you should probably choose the corrected version of the 
{\tt is-reversed} subroutine given in the appendix: 
see Subsection~\ref{sol_isreverse}).


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{testing!is hard}
\index{program!testing}

Testing programs is hard.  The functions in this chapter are
relatively easy to test because you can check the results by hand.
Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to choose a
set of words that test for all possible errors.

Taking \verb"has_no_e" as an example, there are two obvious
cases to check: words that have an ``e'' should return {\tt False}, and
words that don't should return {\tt True}.  You should have no
trouble coming up with one of each.

Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases.  Among the
words that have an ``e'', you should test words with an ``e'' at the
beginning, the end, and somewhere in the middle.  You should test long
words, short words, and very short words, like an empty string.  The
empty string is an example of a {\bf special case}, which is one of
the nonobvious cases where errors often lurk.
\index{special case}

In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test
your program with a word list like \emph{words.txt}.  By scanning
the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:
you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be
included, but are) and not another (words that should be included,
but aren't).

In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to
generate a good set of test cases, and even if you do, you can't
be sure your program is correct.

According to a legendary computer scientist:
\index{testing!and absence of bugs}

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, 
but never to show their absence!

This question is based on a Puzzler that was broadcast on the radio
program {\em Car Talk} 
(\url{http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers}):

\begin{quote}
Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I'll give you a
couple of words that almost qualify, but don't. For example, the word
committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It would be great except for the ``i'' that
sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could
take out those i's it would work. But there is a word that has three
consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may
be the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only
think of one. What is the word?

``I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to
notice my odometer. Like most odometers, it shows six digits,
in whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000
miles, for example, I'd see 3-0-0-0-0-0.

``Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the
last 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as
backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer
could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.

``One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it
could have read 3-6-5-4-5-6.  One mile after that, the middle 4 out of
6 numbers were palindromic.  And you ready for this? One mile later,
all 6 were palindromic!

``The question is, what was on the odometer when I first looked?''

Recently I had a visit with my mom and we realized that
the two digits that make up my age when reversed resulted in her
age. For example, if she's 73, I'm 37. We wondered how often this has
happened over the years but we got sidetracked with other topics and
we never came up with an answer.

When I got home I figured out that the digits of our ages have been
reversible six times so far. I also figured out that if we're lucky it
would happen again in a few years, and if we're really lucky it would
happen one more time after that. In other words, it would have
happened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?

Write a Perl program that searches for solutions to this Puzzler.
Hint: you might find the string formatting method 
{\tt sprintf} useful.
\index{sprintf function}
