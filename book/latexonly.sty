% This file contains global declarations that latex2html doesn't want to
% see.  The latexonly environment doesn't work here because they need

% bigverb is used to typeset verbatim text that is wide and needs to
% be typeset in a smaller font.  latex2html doesn't like the
% \verbatim command and has bigverb support hardcoded into it already,
% that's why it is here in latexonly.sty.
